# heating_network_generation

work in progress, currently not all files uploaded

This project focuses on generating and analyzing heating networks using geospatial data. It integrates geographic information system (GIS) functionality with network analysis to model and simulate heating networks.
Installation and Usage

bash

git clone https://github.com/JonasPfeiffer123/heating_network_generation.git
cd heating_network_generation
